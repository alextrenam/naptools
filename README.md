# About
This package contains some to speed up the generation of commonly-used numerical analysis plots (e.g. error convergence, solution snapshots). Built on matplotlib, the motivation is to minimise the amount of code the end-user needs to write but to still allow flexibility in the plots created.

# Setup
To allow for local import from anywhere run the following command from the repository root directory:
`sudo python3 setup.py install`

This command must also be run each time the source code is updated to see the updates when the package is called.
